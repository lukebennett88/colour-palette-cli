# colour-palette-cli - generate Tailwind colour palettes with npx

This is a fork of [`@danieljpalmer/cli-colour`](https://github.com/danieljpalmer/cli-color)

Generate colour palettes in JSON from your CLI, for use with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) or anything you like. Simply run an npx command

## How to use colour-palette-cli

To use this, just run `npx colour-palette-cli` and follow the steps.

It'll ask you for a primary brand colour (i.e. your root colour), and then ask if you want grays (with the primary colour infused) and utilities (success, error, warning) too.

The palette gets generated instantly and copied to your clipboard for pasting into your Tailwind config file!

## Running it locally

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run `npm start` to achieve the same thing.
